# [DEPRECATED] Nexus Storage Service
The Nexus Storage Service is currently running on the AWS parallel cluster, see [here](https://bbpgitlab.epfl.ch/cs/cloud/aws/parallel-cluster/-/blob/staging/scripts/s3/setup_nexus_storage_service.sh?ref_type=heads) for infrastructure code. For transparency we've copied this configuration to this repo, alongside the rest of the nexus stack.

For OBP launch this parallel cluster instance of the service will be removed in favour of direct uploads through Nexus Delta and S3. See [here](https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/spaces/display/BBPP154/Architecture+to+Manage+Data+in+Lustre+FSx+and+Nexus+Integration) and [here](https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/spaces/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=173211936) for more details about the plan. Long term, the only storage service remaining will be on-premises in Kubernetes.
